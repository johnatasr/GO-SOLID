# Go SOLID

Know about best practicies in software development is not only about do a good code, but create in the long run, the best archtecture with bugless. This repository is about the SOLID principle that remains about five main principles in OOP. I used Golang to representate this theory.


## 1 - Single Responsiblity Principle

A class must have on, only one, reason to change.


## 2 - Open-Closed Principle

Objects or entitites must be open to extesions, but closed to modifications


## 3 - Liskov Substitution Principle

A sub-class must be substitute of a father-class


## 4 - Interface Segregation Principle

 A class don't must be forced to implements interfaces and methods that will not be used.


## 5 - Dependency Inversion Principle

Depends of abstractions and not of implementations.
